# Put

## Introduction
Put is a means to track your software development abilities.
It is based off the 
[Personal Software Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_software_process)
, but utilizes Git as a means to streamline tracking.

The idea is that you will use the `put` command similarly to `git` - but instead
of tracking source code, you track your development capabilities.

The idea for using `put` as the name instead of something else is based on the
explanation of how Git was named, but instead of "global information tracker" it
is the "personal use tracker".

Or depending on if it's working - a piece of utter trash.
